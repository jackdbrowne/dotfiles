# jackdbrowne's dotfiles
This repository contains my personalised linux configuration. This repository is mostly built for my benefit, although others may find it useful. In this repository you will find my configuration for: 

- bspwm (window manager)
- sxhkd (hotkey daemon)
- zsh (shell)
- vim (text editor)
- mutt (mail client)
- Xresources

## Installation

This repo should allow me to get a fresh Arch Linux installation configured with a single command, that is still a work in progress as packages still have to be installed manually.

This repo is heavily influenced by [holman's](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) dotfiles.
